One message from the world of IT Security is &quot;SECURITY =  SEC-<strong>U-R-IT</strong>-Y&quot;, which is to say &ldquo;You are It&rdquo;, emphasizing the point  that every person has an important role to play in protecting the company&rsquo;s  information. </p>

                 <p>Stress that <strong>employees are sometimes the last line of defense</strong>.  It is possible for malicious software agents or social engineering attacks to  penetrate defense systems and reach the user. Therefore, it is beneficial to  train employees to identify threats and to report them to the help desk.  Security training should begin as part of the new employee orientation process.  On-going security awareness should continue using email, the intranet security  web site, and relevant formal classes. These training opportunities can head  off major attacks and keep the company operating, rather than experiencing  major downtime and lost business opportunities. </p>
