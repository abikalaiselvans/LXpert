<p>Software object pooling is not a new concept. There are many 
scenarios where some type of object pooling technique is employed to 
improve application performance, concurrency, and scalability. After 
all, having your database code create a new <code>Connection</code> 
object on every client request is an expensive process. Moreover, with 
today's demanding applications, creating new connections for data access
 from scratch, maintaining them, and tearing down the open connection 
can lead to massive load on the server.</p>

<p><em>Connection pooling</em> eliminates JDBC overhead. Further, object
 pooling also helps to reduce the garbage collection load. In this 
article, we'll look at an elegant way of creating a pool of open 
database-connection objects in Tomcat, so that they are handy whenever 
an application needs to access a DB resource.</p>

<p>With Database Connection Pooling (DBCP), we can scale our 
applications to handle increased load and deliver high performance 
benefits. Using recycled database connection objects cuts the time taken
 to re-instantiate and load frequently used objects, thus reducing 
unnecessary overheads. Configuring a DB pool can be a daunting task, 
because there has to be a way for different components within an 
application to know about the available pooled objects, and a mechanism 
to locate them. This is exactly where JNDI steps in, tying these 
dependencies together.</p>

<h3>JNDI to the Rescue</h3>

<p>The Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) has been at the core 
of Java EE since its inception. JNDI offers a generic mechanism for Java
 EE components to find other components, resources, or services 
indirectly at runtime. The primary role of JNDI in a Java EE application
 is to provide an <em>indirection layer</em>, so that components can 
find required resources without being particularly aware of the 
indirection. This indirection is almost transparent. JNDI helps in 
holding applications together, but this coupling is very flexible, so 
that apps can be easily reassembled. JNDI spares you from providing 
direct references to the data source, JDBC driver class names, user 
names and passwords, or any vendor-specific quirks of setting up 
pooling. We just look up all of these dependencies at runtime through a 
JNDI call. The developer, on the other hand, is ignorant of the external
 resources.</p>

<h3>Tomcat Configuration</h3>

<p>Our approach to DBCP uses the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/">Jakarta-Commons</a> database connection pool. But first, we need to configure the JNDI <code>DataSource</code> in Tomcat by adding a declaration for the resource to <em>server.xml</em> file, which resides inside the <em>/conf</em> directory of your Tomcat installation (indicated by the environment variable <code>CATALINA_HOME</code>). The JNDI <code>DataSource</code> is used as a <em>factory</em>
 for connections. One of the major advantages of using a configuration 
like this is that the characteristics of the pool can be changed without
 affecting the application code. Our application's use of connection 
pooling is almost transparent. The following code snippet shows us how 
to configure the container to enable connection pooling.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Context path="/dbcp" docBase="dbcp" debug="5"
reloadable="true" crossContext="true"&gt;

&lt;Resource name="jdbc/TestDB" auth="Container"
   type="javax.sql.DataSource" removeAbandoned="true"
   removeAbandonedTimeout="30" maxActive="100"
   maxIdle="30" maxWait="10000" username="kunal"
   password="java_facier"
   driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
   url="jdbc:mysql://localhost/dbcptest"/&gt;

&lt;/Context&gt;</code></pre>

<p>We can configure a maximum number of DB connections in the pool. Make
 sure you choose a maximum connection count large enough to handle all 
of your database connections--alternatively, you can set <code>0</code> 
for no limit. Further, we can set the maximum number of idle database 
connections to be retained in the pool. Set this value to <code>-1</code>
 for no limit. The most optimal performance is attained when the pool in
 its steady state contains just enough connections to service all 
concurrent connection requests, without having to create new physical 
database connections at runtime. We can also specify the maximum time 
(in milliseconds) to wait for a database connection to become available,
 which in this example is 10 seconds. An exception is thrown if this 
timeout is exceeded. You can set this value to <code>-1</code> to wait indefinitely. Please make sure your connector driver, such as <em>mysql.jar</em>, is placed inside the <em>/common/lib</em> directory of your Tomcat installation.</p>

<p>To achieve performance and high throughput, we also need to fine-tune
 the container to work under heavy traffic. Here's how we'll configure 
the <code>Connector</code> element for the <code>maxProcessors</code> and <code>acceptCount</code> parameters in the <em>server.xml</em> file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!--  Configuring the request and response endpoints --&gt;
&lt;Connector port="80" maxHttpHeaderSize="8192" maxProcessors="150"
   maxThreads="150" minSpareThreads="25" maxSpareThreads="75"
   enableLookups="false" redirectPort="8443" acceptCount="150"
   connectionTimeout="20000" disableUploadTimeout="true" /&gt;</code></pre>

<h3><a name="jndiref" id="jndiref"></a>Configuring JNDI Reference</h3>

<p>In order for JNDI to resolve the reference, we have to insert a <code>&lt;resource-ref&gt;</code> tag into the <em>web.xml</em> deployment descriptor file. We first begin by setting a <code>&lt;listener&gt;</code> tag for registering a <code>ServletContextListener</code> as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;listener&gt;
        &lt;listener-class&gt; com.onjava.dbcp.DBCPoolingListener&lt;/listener-class&gt;
&lt;/listener&gt;

&lt;!-- This component has a dependency on an external resource--&gt;
 &lt;resource-ref&gt;
      &lt;description&gt; DB Connection Pooling&lt;/description&gt;
      &lt;res-ref-name&gt; jdbc/TestDB&lt;/res-ref-name&gt;
      &lt;res-type&gt; javax.sql.DataSource&lt;/res-type&gt;
      &lt;res-auth&gt; Container&lt;/res-auth&gt;
  &lt;/resource-ref&gt;

&lt;servlet&gt;
        &lt;servlet-name&gt; EnrolledStudents&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
        &lt;servlet-class&gt; com.onjava.dbcp.CourseEnrollmentServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
        &lt;load-on-startup&gt; 1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;

&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
        &lt;servlet-name&gt; EnrolledStudents&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
        &lt;url-pattern&gt; /enrollment.do&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;</code></pre>

<p>This binding is vendor-specific, and every container has its own 
mechanism for setting data sources. Please note that this is just a 
declaration for dependency on an external resource, and doesn't create 
the actual resource. Comprehending the tags is pretty straightforward: 
this indicates to the container that the local reference name <em>jdbc/TestDB</em> should be set by the app deployer, and this should match with the resource name, as declared in <em>server.xml</em> file.</p>

<p>As our application first starts asking the pool for <code>Connection</code>
 objects, they will be newly created, but when the application has 
finished with an object, it's returned to the pool rather than 
destroyed. This has huge performance benefits. Now, as the application 
needs more <code>Connection</code> objects, the pool will be able to issue recycled objects that have previously been returned by the application.</p>

<p>As an example, let's create a listener class to work with the pool. Our listener class implements the <code>ServletContextListener</code> interface; thus, it'll be initialized when the container starts and creates a <code>ServletContext</code> for this web app. Remember, there's only one <code>ServletContext</code> per web app. Any class implementing the <code>ServletContextListener</code>
 interface is initialized when the container starts. This early 
initialization cuts unnecessary overhead later, since it's ideal to have
 a cached set of open database connection objects available when the 
container starts rather than waiting for a client request. Inside the 
listener class, we'll do the necessary JNDI lookup and then set the <code>DataSource</code> as a <code>ServletContext</code> attribute so that it's available to the entire web app. The following code snippet shows us how to extract <code>DataSource</code> through a JNDI call:</p>

<pre><code>public class DBCPoolingListener implements
ServletContextListener{
 public void contextInitialized
  (ServletContextEvent sce){

  try {
    // Obtain our environment naming context
    Context envCtx = (Context) new InitialContext().
    lookup("java:comp/env");

    // Look up our data source
    DataSource  ds = (DataSource) envCtx.lookup
       ("jdbc/TestDB");

    sce.getServletContext().setAttribute
      ("DBCPool", ds);
   } catch(NamingException e){ e.printStackTrace();
  }
 }
 public void contextDestroyed(ServletContextEvent
 sce){
 }
}</code></pre>

<p>The component naming context is indicated by the prefix <code>java:comp/env/</code>.</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, we'll create a simple servlet, 
hard-coding the business logic and presentation. We'll use the JDBC 2.0 
Standard Extension API, which specifies that a database service provider
 can implement a pooling technique that can allow multiple <code>Connection</code> objects to be shared among several requesting clients. Here's how we'll extract <code>DataSource</code> from the <code>ServletContext</code> attribute and then establish a <code>Connection</code> to pooled DB connection objects.</p>

<pre><code>public void init() throws ServletException {
    try {
 //Create a datasource for pooled connections.
 datasource = (DataSource) getServletContext().
 getAttribute("DBCPool");

  //Register the driver for non-pooled connections.
  Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver").
      newInstance();
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
      throw new ServletException(e.getMessage());
    }
  }</code></pre>

<p>The servlet is written to use either pooled or non-pooled database 
connections, depending on the query string passed in its URL. The 
servlet fetches a pooled connection object using Tomcat DBCP, and 
non-pooled connections directly from MySQL connector.</p>

<p>Here's an example of obtaining a <code>Connection</code> object. If the <code>pooledConnection</code> flag is set, it simply calls <code>getConnection()</code> on the <code>DataSource</code>. If not, it manually creates a new <code>Connection</code> object:</p>

<pre><code>private synchronized Connection getConnection
    (boolean pooledConnection)
    throws SQLException {
  if (pooledConnection) {
     pooledCount++;

    // Allocate and use a connection from the pool
    return datasource.getConnection();
  }
  else {

    nonPooledCount++;
    Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(
      "jdbc:mysql://localhost/dbcptest","kunal",
      "java_facier");
    return con;   //return a newly created object
    }
  }</code></pre>

<p>Having acquired a <code>Connection</code>, the servlet executes a 
simple join between the course and enrollment tables, and then formats 
and outputs the results as HTML. The example uses <code>PreparedStatement</code>
 to pre-compile SQL and run it repeatedly. This eliminates the tedious 
task of parsing and compiling the SQL query on every client request. 
Pre-compilation improves performance and offers enhanced security by 
preventing SQL injection attacks. For thread safety, we'll keep <code>Connection</code>, <code>PreparedStatement</code>, and <code>ResultSet</code> as local variables inside of the <code>doGet()</code> method.</p>

<p>Connections issued from the JNDI <code>DataSource</code> factory will
 be returned to the pool when closed. Clients use a connection pool by 
borrowing a connection object, using it, and then returning it to the 
pool by closing it. We have to make sure that after we are done with the
 <code>Connection</code>, we close it. If a <code>Connection</code> is 
not closed, it will never be returned to the pool and become available 
for reuse. Of course, that would tie up resources. The <code>finally</code> block guarantees that used <code>ResultSet</code>, <code>PreparedStatement</code>, and <code>Connection</code> objects are closed and prevents any connection pool leaks, as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>
finally {
      try {if (rs != null) rs.close();} catch (SQLException e) {}
      try {if (pstmt != null) pstmt.close();} catch (SQLException e) {}
      try {if (connection != null) connection.close();} catch (SQLException e) {}
    }</code></pre>

<h3>Performance Measurement</h3>

</csinclude></csinclude></csinclude></a><p><a href="http://onjava.com/onjava/2006/04/19/%3C%21--CS_NEXT_REF--%3E">Before
 our application hits the ground running, we would like to stress test 
the app, evaluate its performance, and compare the results between the 
cached set of pooled connection objects and the non-pooling alternative.
 For this, we'll rely on </a><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/index.html">JMeter</a>,
 an open source tool for load testing with a drag-and-drop-style GUI. I 
have written a test plan for stress testing the web app. I have set up 
JMeter to stimulate 50 concurrent users, accessing a common servlet two 
times without any interval. The results are pretty apparent after 
looking at the JMeter graph results shown in Figures 1 and 2, below.</p>

<p><a href="http://onjava.com/onjava/2006/04/19/graphics/pooling_test.jpg" target="_blank" onclick="PopImage('', this.href, '919', '692', 'Figure 1.

<em>Figure 2. Non-pooled DB connections deviation</em> (click for full-size image)</p>

<p>After several test runs, it turned out that connection pooling is at 
least four times faster than explicitly creating a DB connection object 
from the ground up. Admittedly, to get more accurate results, JMeter 
should run on a different machine. The ramp-up period, which describes 
the amount of time for creating the total number of threads, should be 
carefully chosen. It's not considered to be a good idea to set it to 
zero if you have a large number of threads, because that would create 
all of the threads at once and send out requests immediately. At the 
same time, a higher ramp-up period is also not appropriate, as it might 
underestimate the results.</p>

<h3><a name="conclusion" id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Connection pooling is a technique used for sharing a cached set of 
open database connections among several requesting clients. It doesn't 
require you to modify your code significantly; rather, it provides 
enhanced performance benefits. Object pooling should be used with care. 
It does require additional overhead for such tasks as managing the state
 of the object pool, issuing objects to the application, and recycling 
used objects. Pooling is best suited for objects that have a short 
lifetime. If you are already working in a rich Java EE environment, then
 most likely you would be using an out-of-box connection pooling 
facility provided by your app server, and your applications' use of 
connection pooling is almost transparent.</p>
