Request Dispatcher is an Interface which is used to 
dispatch the request or response from web resource to the another web resource.
It contains mainly two methods..

1)request.forward(req,res):This method is used forward the request 
from one web resource to another resource. i.e from one servlet 
to another servlet or from one web application to another web appliacation.

2)response.include(req,res):This method is used include the response of one servlet
 to another servlet

NOTE: BY using Request Dispatcher we can forward or include the request or responses 
with in the same server.

request.sendRedirect(): BY using this we can orward or include the request or responses 
across the different servers. In this the client gets a intimation
 while redirecting the page but in the above process
  the client will not get itimation
