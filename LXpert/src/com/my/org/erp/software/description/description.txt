Modules are available in Attendance And Payroll
===============================================
We deployed the web version of Wings Auto, Wings Accounting, 
and Wings Payroll so that we have one system covering all our
 branches and locations. We are able to manage all branches, 
 and all users, centrally. The software takes care of all 
 our requirements and business processes. We have been able 
 to automate and integrate our front offices, workshops, 
 accounting, inventory and payroll efficiently.
  We get excellent analysis and reports from the system.
   Wings is also very easy to learn and use.
    I would strongly recommend Wings to anyone.

	Enterprise resource planning (ERP) integrates internal and external management information across an entire organization, embracing finance/accounting, manufacturing, sales and service, customer relationship management, etc. ERP systems automate this activity with an integrated software application. Its purpose is to facilitate the flow of information between all business functions inside the boundaries of the organization and manage the connections to outside stakeholders.
ERP systems can run on a variety of hardware and network configurations, typically employing a database as a repository for information 
ERP systems typically include the following characteristics:
•	An integrated system that operates in real time (or next to real time), without relying on periodic updates 
•	A common database, which supports all applications.
•	A consistent look and feel throughout each module.
•	Installation of the system without elaborate application/data integration by the Information Technology (IT) department

Attendance 

Many companies need to keep track of what their employees are doing day-to-day.  This information is needed to process payroll, determine labor costs on individual tasks, jobs and projects, and track individual productivity.   Hourly or waged-based employees, as opposed to salary-based employees, are usually familiar with timing or logging in at the beginning and end of the work day, but frequently it is desirable to have finer resolution of the time spent during the work day, for both the wage and salary based workforce.  For instance, if  a machinist works on four different parts for three different projects in the course of a workday, to accurately calculate job cost, he would have had to record the starting and end times for each task.  This is also true for the salary based engineer that works on four different drawings in the course of a day.
Time and attendance calculations are further complicated by the wide range of hourly charges in a typical shift.  For instance, time charges may be classified as overtime or double-time after a certain period, or the workday may fall on a holiday or weekend.   Sometimes there are supplemental shift surcharges; for instance, for the night or overnight shifts.  If a facility is running more than one shift, with dozens of jobs and hundreds of tasks, all being worked concurrently and subject to the variations just described, it can be impossible for facility management to accurately calculate job cost or individual productivity.  
With the traditional methods of time management, all too often management loses the finer resolution wherein resides the bulk of the information that can be compiled as part of a larger strategy to reduce job and task cost and increase worker productivity.  Furthermore, without this finer resolution, there can be no effective way to accurately monitor the return on investment for new assets that were purchased ostensibly to reduce task cost but more realistically were acquired without any major cost analysis, simply because the data to perform that analysis were not available.
These deficiencies are addressed with our Time and Attendance module.  With this module, we provide a means to track individual task time and thus cost, and compare that cost with original estimates.  The historical data that you compile can then be used to more accurately estimate costs on future projects.  In conjunction with our Workscope Management module, these times and costs can even be analyzed on a skill level basis, providing you with a multi-dimensional cost analysis and estimate tool.  This finer resolution is what is required to monitor whether or not a specific capital investment yields the reduction in task cost and increase in profitability that was the reason for the investment (see Asset Management).  This information obviously interfaces then with payroll, but in conjunction with our Human Resources module, task/skill level progress can be monitored on an employee basis, allowing you to monitor the return on training and education expenses, and whether those investments were justified. 
In short, there is almost no limit on the amount of fine analysis that can be performed with this information.  To discuss your specific requirements, please contact us at any time.

This assessment will be done by taking into account the Customers Order received, Inventory in hand, Scrap etc. Taking all these into account Departments will be filling Minimum Inventory Requirement.

What is Minimum Inventory Requirement?
Minimum Inventory Requirement is that quantity of inventory below which workers cannot work i.e. it is that quantity of inventory, which is minimum, required accomplishing the task of Student. Hence stock of inventory should not go below this amount.
Maximum Inventory Assessment
In this particular module the objective is to get the maximum Inventory requirement from different Departments.
A Performa is prepared in which different departments have to fill up there maximum inventory requirement in coming 15 days i.e. we are planning for ahead what will be the inventory requirement in near future. We are taking Maximum Inventory Requirement for this reason so that to assure that wastage does not happen and there is no blocking of funds unnecessary. This assessment will be done by taking into account the Customers Order received, Inventory in hand, Scrap, Durable goods, Non Durable goods etc. Taking all these into account Departments will be filling Maximum Inventory Requirement.
What is Maximum Inventory Requirement?
Maximum Inventory Requirement is that quantity of inventory above which order for Inventory should not be placed i.e. it is that quantity of inventory, which is enough to accomplish the task of Student. The stock of inventory above this quantity will result in wastage and blocking of funds.
Inventory Requisition
In this particular module the objective is to take the inventory requirement from different departments of the Student. This is done by filling up of Inventory Requisition form by different departments. In this particular form the Department head will fill up the quantity of Inventory required, Grade / quality of Inventory required etc. Department head should take into account the minimum inventory required, maximum inventory required and current inventory available.
Inventory Order Assessment
This is back end program written in Java Servlets. This program is actually assessing the Inventory requirements of the Company.
It takes the Input from the Inventory Requisition form and processes it i.e. it then compares the Inventory demanded by different departments with the minimum inventory required according to customers order.
After processing the results it makes the final Inventory requirement for different departments and then call for Suppliers list that provides these inventory.
Supplier Performa
In this module the quotation for Inventory requisition is called from different suppliers. Suppliers will be filling up the Proposal Form in which they will be stating that:
•	How much quantity of goods they can provide?
•	In what time?
•	What will be pay mode?
•	Are they providing Credit?
•	What will be the Quantity of goods?
•	What will be the Price per Item?
All this information will be stored and then will be processed by the program which then taking into account all the above filled information will finalize the supplier. Inventory ordered should be cost effective and should be of good quality
Inventory Placing
Now the supplier is selected we have to finally place an order. We have to fill up order placing form in which we will be filling up information like Date of Placing of Order, Quality required, Transportation Mode, Mode of Payment, Advance Payment, Supplier ID, Department ID, price per Item etc. and the order will be placed.
Order Received
Next module is Order Received module in this module we will be recording the Inventory received information. We will be comparing order placed and order received data i.e. weather there is uniformity between these two or not. We will be comparing Date of placing order and Date of receiving order, Quality of Inventory, Quantity of order received and Quantity of order placed, Transport mode etc. If there is uniformity in both then we will be assessing the amount to be paid to the supplier. We will be taking into account the quantity received, price per Item and advance paid.
Quality Assessment
We have received order then it have to pass through quality checks by R&D Department and Department head has to fill up quality assessment form indicating the quality of goods received.
